In Threat 3, the frontend encrypts the username, email, and password using AES-CBC with a fixed key and IV, then sends the data to the backend via HTTP. A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) proxy intercepts the traffic, attempts to brute-force the encrypted data using a key list, logs the cracked credentials to mitm_capture.log, and forwards the original encrypted data to the backend. To defend against this, the improved version uses 2048-bit RSA encryption on the client side, making brute-force attacks impractical. It also implements email-based OTP verification during login, bcrypt hashing for passwords, a polished UI, and logs all major events to app.log. To run: install dependencies with pip install flask flask-cors bcrypt cryptography, then start the server
